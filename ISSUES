 * Change exit(1) either to exit(EXIT_FAILURE) or to thrown exceptions to get the stack trace
 * Check function class that returns Object to see whether we can use references
 * Change enums to static class members
 * Replace direct access to FieldOperation members by getters & setters
!* What happens in case of consecutive ranged write + write conditions?
		--> a write condition has to mention which element wrote it
!* Write range -> replace by DisjointSegmentList?
		--> RoundRobinIPMapper takes discrete inputs
!* Add "Unsupported Elements" category ==> allow to use unsupported elements anyway
		--> can still look at (if it applies) the modified/read fields

!!!filter_from_ip_option in ip_filter_parser.cpp creates Filter(ip_proto, 6); for UDP

TODO:
	* add ID to all elements
	* add pointer->element in Write operations
	* Check inport assignments for non-active ports
	* Compile tests with autotools
	* Use m4/hypernf.m4 to apply system checks (e.g., CXX compiler, CLICK, DPDK) and alleviate configure.ac
