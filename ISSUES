 * Change exit(1) either to exit(EXIT_FAILURE) or to thrown exceptions to get
 	the stack trace
 * Check function class that returns Object to see whether we can use references
 * Change enums to static class members
 * Replace direct access to FieldOperation members by getters & setters
!* What happens in case of consecutive ranged write + write conditions?
		--> a write condition has to mention which element wrote it
!* Write range -> replace by DisjointSegmentList?
		--> RoundRobinIPMapper takes discrete inputs
!* Add "Unsupported Elements" category ==> allow to use unsupported elements anyway
		--> can still look at (if it applies) the modified/read fields

TODO:
	* add ID to all elements
	* add pointer->element in Write operations
	* In click/click_parse_configuration.cpp, we should delete the click_master 
	object at the end of the parsing.
	* In method build_nf_tree of parser/chain_parser.cpp, the Click function downstream_elements
	is deprecated but they only one I managed to make it work.
