 * What if an element classifies from an already rewritten field
	EXAMPLE: IPRewrite->RadixLookup
	SOLUTIONS: IPRewrite makes the output of RadixLookup deterministic
		--> We should store an actual state of the field in the TrafficClass

 * Change outputPort to createdClasses
 * Change exit(1) either to exit(EXIT_FAILURE) or to thrown exceptions to get
 	the stack trace
 * Check function class that returns Object to see whether we can use references
